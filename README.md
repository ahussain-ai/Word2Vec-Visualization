### Word2Vec Visualization
This repository contains tools for visualizing word embeddings generated using Word2Vec.

#### Overview
Word2Vec is a popular technique for learning word embeddings from large text corpora. These word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, making them useful for a variety of natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and named entity recognition.

This repository provides a simple web-based tool for visualizing word embeddings in two or three dimensions. The visualization allows users to explore the relationships between words in a visually intuitive way, making it easier to understand the semantic structure of the embedding space.

#### Features
Interactive Visualization: The visualization tool allows users to explore word embeddings in an interactive and intuitive way.
Customization: Users can adjust various parameters such as the number of dimensions and the distance metric used for visualizing word embeddings.
Scalability: The tool is designed to handle large vocabularies and embeddings, allowing users to visualize word embeddings trained on extensive text corpora.


The project, Word2Vec Visualization, focuses on providing tools for visualizing word embeddings generated using Word2Vec, a popular technique in natural language processing (NLP) for learning distributed representations of words in a continuous vector space.

Here's an overview of what was done in the project:

1. Word Embedding Generation:
The project likely begins with the generation of word embeddings using the Word2Vec algorithm. Word2Vec learns to represent words in a high-dimensional vector space where words with similar meanings are located close to each other. This step involves training Word2Vec on a large text corpus, such as Wikipedia articles, news articles, or any other relevant dataset.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Before training the Word2Vec model, the text data undergoes preprocessing steps such as tokenization, removing stop words, punctuation, and possibly stemming or lemmatization. These steps help to clean and prepare the text data for training the word embeddings.

3. Training the Word2Vec Model:
The Word2Vec model is trained on the preprocessed text data to learn the distributed representations of words. The training process involves predicting the context words given a target word (Skip-gram model) or predicting the target word given a context (Continuous Bag of Words model). During training, the model adjusts the word embeddings to minimize the loss function, effectively learning to capture the semantic relationships between words.

4. Visualization Tool Development:
After generating the word embeddings, the project focuses on developing a visualization tool to explore and analyze the embeddings. This tool likely utilizes libraries such as matplotlib, plotly, or bokeh for creating interactive visualizations. The tool allows users to explore the semantic relationships between words in the embedding space by visualizing them in two or three dimensions.

5. Interactive Exploration: 
The visualization tool provides an interactive interface where users can interact with the word embeddings. Users can pan, zoom, and click on words to see their nearest neighbors in the embedding space. This interactive exploration makes it easier to understand the semantic structure of the embedding space and discover relationships between words.

6. Customization Options:
The visualization tool may offer customization options such as adjusting the number of dimensions, choosing different distance metrics (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance), or applying dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) to visualize the embeddings in a more interpretable manner.

Overall, the project aims to provide a user-friendly tool for visualizing and exploring word embeddings generated using Word2Vec, facilitating better understanding and analysis of the semantic relationships between words in natural language text
